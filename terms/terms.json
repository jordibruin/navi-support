	"terms": "By using Navi you agree to the following terms of use. Navi is an app that lets you view captions (subtitles) for what other people around you are saying. When you do not use the translation feature, and you're connecting to other Navi users, all messages are sent directly between devices. No data is sent to a server or anywhere else. When you enable the translation feature, your messages are sent to DeepL through the Navi backend. These translations are deleted immediately after the translation has been sent to you. We don't keep track of any data. Note that translations may not be perfect and could have mistakes. We are not responsible for any mistranslations.",
	"privacy": "In short: We don't want to know anything about your device. We don't want to know anything about you. When using Navi without the translation feature, all messages are sent directly between your devices. When you use the translation feature, incoming subtitles are sent to our server and then sent to DeepL for translating them. Your conversations are not stored anywhere and we use the normal terms of DeepL which state that translations are automatically deleted after they are retrieved. Please see their privacy policy for more information and details. Navi tracks a few anonymous analytics events to improve performance of the app."
